# OpenPose Android Demo

Testing running the OpenPose inference model on Android device with [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite).

- I migrate all python code (includign dependencies) to Java
- Based on 'TensorFlow Android Camera Demo'
- Inference model converter to TFLite using convert.py

Based on a Tensorflow + Python implementation https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation at commit [0031b4e](https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation/tree/0031b4e7fd312f561cc73b9289fd6d36af59db4a)

The original OpenPose implementation can be found on https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose
